# phylo_likelihood_bayesian
Python files that generate trees, caculate the likelihood + MCMC files + representation files \
230612_i0change.py: A python code to generate tree based on initial infected (i0), calculate likelihood, run MCMC \
plotting_sampled.py: based on 230612_i0change.py to have sampled as a trajectory or on the infected line \
230630_simTree.py: a script to simulate a tree. It doesnâ€™t have class and it is written to be called from bash with this command: \
chmod +x /Users/siavashriazi/Desktop/SFU/Codes/Python/simTree_230630.py \
Loop: \
sum=0 \
for i in {1..100}; do \
    size=$(python simTree_230630.py) \
    sum=$(awk "BEGIN {print $sum + $size; exit}") \
done \
mean=$(awk "BEGIN {print $sum / 100; exit}") \
echo "Mean Tree Size: $mean"
